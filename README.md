# Benders Decomposition
The benders.py file is a program that solves the specific problem outlined in Chapter 2 of my thesis submitted to Pomona College in partial fullfillment of
the Degree of Bachelor of Arts. The problem is hard-coded into our program, and begins with the Dual Subproblem. That is, the program does not outline the original
linear program and rather begins with the problem's dual after accounting for the user's inputted value for $\hat{y}$. This program was an interesting extension
of my thesis after struggling to find readily available Benders Decomposition solvers online.
